## Installation Options

This is a terraform module that creates an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Read Only integration with Bridgecrew.

### Starting fresh

This stack creates a role with a dedicated External ID which allows only authorized access from Bridgecrew's AWS account

## Usage

Include **module.readonly.tf** in your existing Terraform code, and/or see *example/examplea* as your guide:

```terraform
module "readonly" {
  source      = "bridgecrewio/bridgecrew-read-only/aws"
  version     = "v1.5.4"
  org_name    = "<your org name>"
  aws_profile = "<aws profile>"
  api-token   = var.api_token
}
```

The module requires that you set your Bridgecrew organisation name and the name of the AWS profile of the AWS account you want to attach Bridgecrew too.

The module expect the Bridgecrew platform API token to be supplied.

On Windows:

```powershell
$env:TF_VAR_api_token="your-platform-token"
```

On *nix:

```shell
export TF_VAR_api_token="your-platform-token"
```

Or you can leave it blank to be prompted at your console.

This module is supported for deployment in the following AWS regions:

- All US regions
- eu-west-1
- eu-central-1
- ap-northeast-1

However, its functionality will work across all AWS regions.
